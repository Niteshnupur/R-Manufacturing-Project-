Part backorders is a common supply chain problem. Working to identify parts at risk of backorder before the event occurs so the business has time to react. Data file contains the historical data for the 8 weeks prior to the week we are trying to predict. The data was taken as weekly snapshots at the start of each week.

went_on_backorder - Product actually went on backorder or not. This is the target value.

We have given you two datasets , product_train.csv and product_test.csv . You need to use data product_train to build predictive model for response variable ‘went_on_backorder’. product_test data contains all other factors except ‘went_on_backorder’, you need to predict that using the model that you developed and submit your predicted values in a csv files.

You have to submit the response as hard classes (Yes or No)

Evaluation Criterion : KS score on test data.

Score will be calculated as score = 1-(0.025/KS) 

For passing your score should be greater than 0.501

Your predictions should not contain any NA values.
